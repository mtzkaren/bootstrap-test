    <h1>New York Cheesecake recipe</h1>
    <p class="intro">We find that different generations have different ideas about what a typical New York cheesecake is. To us, a New York cheesecake is high, firm, and dense, with a slightly lemony flavor. The Lindy's cheesecake in our January 1991 issue, adapted here for a simpler crust, is all of that. It's also a cake that keeps for up to two weeks and lends itself easily to flavor variations.</p>

    <h3 class="section-header">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1 crumb-crust recipe, made with finely ground graham crackers</li>
      <li>5 (8-oz) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Finely grated zest of 1 orange</li>
      <li>Finely grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
      <li>5 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="section-header">Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Make crumb crust as directed in separate recipe. Preheat oven to 550°F.</li>
      <li>Beat together cream cheese, sugar, flour, and zests with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs and yolks, 1 at a time, then vanilla, beating on low speed until each ingredient is incorporated and scraping down bowl between additions.</li>
      <li>Put springform pan with crust in a shallow baking pan. Pour filling into crust (springform pan will be completely full) and bake in baking pan (to catch drips) in middle of oven 12 minutes, or until puffed. Reduce temperature to 200°F and continue baking until cake is mostly firm (center will still be slightly wobbly when pan is gently shaken), about 1 hour more.</li>
      <li>Run a knife around top edge of cake to loosen and cool completely in springform pan on a rack. Chill cake, loosely covered, at least 6 hours. Remove side of pan and transfer cake to a plate. Bring to room temperature before serving.</li>
    </ol>
